# Control Flow Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice working with loops and conditionals.
Think of it as doing reps or practicing scales! The more you practice, the
better you'll get.

## Prerequisites

- Fundamental JavaScript: syntax, data types, and arrays
- Conditions, including `if`, `if`/`else`, and `if`/`else if`/`else`
- Loops, both `for` loops and `while` loops

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar, homework is due the next morning by
9:00am.

**Make a commit after each prompt.**

## Requirements

There are a series of prompts inside [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js).
Work through all of the prompts. Each prompt is in the form of a JavaScript
comment. Write your code to solve the prompt after the comment. Commit your code
after you solve a prompt.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class. This is intended to help you learn to become a more independent developer.

### Reminder: You are required to make a commit after each prompt.

### Optional:

**If you're curious about whether your code passes the tests written for this assignment, you can do the following:**

1. From inside this directory, run `npm install` in your terminal. This will download the testing dependencies (mocha and chai).
1. Run `npm test` in the directory. Read the output to checkout which tests your code is passing and failing.
1. If there are any errors, try fixing them and running the code again.
